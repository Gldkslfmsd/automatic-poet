Specification:
--------------

Our task is to create a generator of an accentual-syllabic poetry.

Verses in this kind of poetry are restricted by the rhythm of accents, all
verses must have the same number of syllables and the verses in the strophe
rhyme by the chosen pattern. See Shakespeare's sonnets as an example.




HMM will be trained on n-grams of syllables. Generator's input will be the
format of the poem and on output there will be a text which is pronouncable,
reminds given language and author, fits the given format precisly and
doesn't have any meaning.

I can use my rule-based implementation of automatic syllabizer for Czech
and train the model on Czech poetry. If I find a syllabizer for other
language, I can adapt it for it as well.


There isn't any other motivation for implementing this except the fact that
the
generated poems could be entertaining, unique and possibly interesting
texts. This idea is in my TODO list for 5 years, since the times when
I learned programming, so also for me personally it would be a completed
task.
